\usage{
CorMID(
  int = NULL,
  fml = "",
  r = NULL,
  penalize = 7,
  mid_fix = NULL,
  trace_steps = FALSE,
  prec = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{int}{Named numeric vector of measured ion intensities of a fragment. Names will give position of values relative to M+H (see details).}

\item{fml}{Chemical formula of the fragment as string.}

\item{r}{Either a character vector giving fragments to be considered
OR a named numeric giving relative amounts of fragments
OR NULL (all known fragments will  be estimated)
OR a 2-row matrix giving the lower and upper allowed ratio (see examples).}

\item{penalize}{Numeric exponent penalizing solutions with low M+H occurence. Formula is 1+3*(1-x)^penalty. NA to omit penalizing.}

\item{mid_fix}{May provide a numeric vector used as a given MID. Allows to estimate \emph{r} individually.}

\item{trace_steps}{For testing purposes. Print the results of intermediate steps to console.}

\item{prec}{Precision of the estimation of MID, set to 1\% as default.}
}
\value{
Estimated percent representation of each isotopologue measured (corMID).
}
\description{
\code{CorMID} will compute a MID (Mass Isotopomer Distribution)
 based on measured ion intensities in GC-APCI-MS.
}
\details{
Let's assume we measured the ion intensities of all 3 isotopes of an
 individual compound containing 2 carbons and observe a vector of {978,22,0}.
 We may calculate the enrichment \strong{E} out of this data, i.e. the relative proportion
 of 13C vs total carbon which will amount to about 1.1\% (the natural 13C abundance)
 under standard conditions.
 The equvivalent corMID vector would be {1,0,0}, indicating that the non-labeled
 isotopologue (where non-labeled means non-labled above the natural 1.1\%)
 is the only component observed.
 During a labelling experiment we may change the measurement values in different
 ways (either labelling only one carbon or both), which potentially can translate
 into similar values for \strong{E} being larger 1.1\%.
 The MIDs will provide additional information about the isotopologue fraction
 which gave rise to the observed \strong{E}'s (cf. examples). The \emph{r} parameter
 indicates an overlay of chemical rearrangements which may occur.
