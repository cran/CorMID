Description: In metabolic flux experiments tracer molecules (often glucose containing 
    labelled carbon) are incorporated in compounds measured using mass spectrometry.
    The mass isotopologue distributions of these compounds needs to be corrected for
    natural abundance of labelled carbon and other effects, which are specific on the
    compound and ionization technique applied. This package provides functions to
    correct such effects in gas chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
    mass spectrometry analyses.
